          PuttiForms is a form generation and business process management tool that boasts a large variety of features. It supports a large range of devices, including Android, iOS, Web, and Windows Devices.Intended to replace traditional paper based processes within business environments (think health and safety, HR, customer management), while leaving the survey space to existing form builders. The web application contained all the necessary features to build forms, with validation, customisable fields and submission reporting.
          More advanced features included dynamic tables with spreadsheet style calculation, GPS, user permissions, and notifications to manage work flows.Due to business users often having their own IT systems managing their data, a series of secure APIs were developed to allow customers to source their own data for form creation, as well as retrieving the resulting form submissions. The application was built as a monthly subscription service and also including a payment system and administrator backend.

        text: 'I developed PuttiForms over 3 years, designing the architecture, creating APIs and fully implementing the front and backend. The project started out with just me and a native developer. As the application picked up clients, I began to lead a larger team of developers to continue expanding product features and meet customer requirements.'
