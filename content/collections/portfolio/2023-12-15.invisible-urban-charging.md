        text: "I led a team to build the backend software that would manage, connect to, and utilise all these new chargers. This includes APIs to communicate with the user app, admin management software to control the sites and charging stations. In particular, based on existing charging protocols, I built the middleware that would control the charging devices directly and get people's cars back on the road."
